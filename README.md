# modular-quote-machine
another random quote generator. Built to practice modular code design and the build tool gulp

For this micro project I followed Jay Schwane's guide on medium: https://medium.com/@jrschwane/writing-modular-javascript-pt-1-b42a3bd23685

The code is 98% his, but typed out line by line.

The project is deployed on surge and can be found at: http://yummy-government.surge.sh/
